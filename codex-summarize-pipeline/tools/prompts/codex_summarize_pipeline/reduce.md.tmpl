You are reducing a set of partial summaries into a smaller summary.
Rules:
- Output MUST be <= $final_max_words words.
- Keep a practical “how-to” shape when the inputs contain steps/settings/examples.
- Prefer actionable steps, settings, and example SQL; minimize design rationale.
- De-duplicate repeated points.
- Preserve concrete numbers/dates when present.
- Do not mention that you are reducing or that there were chunks.
- Output only the summary text.
Formatting rules:
- Keep markdown headings if helpful.
- Keep fenced code blocks when present; keep them short.
- Prefer to include a short `## Verification` section if inputs mention how to check progress/impact.
