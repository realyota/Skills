You are reading a single chunk from a larger article.
Do NOT run any commands or tools.
Do NOT add filler. Be information-dense and practical.
If something is uncertain, say so briefly.

CHUNK $chunk_index/$chunk_count:
-----
$chunk_text
-----

Task: Extract ONLY content relevant to this goal:
GOAL: $goal

Output format (markdown; keep it concise):
- Prefer actionable “how-to” material over explanations of design decisions.
- Include concrete settings/flags and their values when mentioned.
- Include short example SQL snippets (fenced code blocks) if the chunk contains enough detail.
- Include 2–6 “gotchas/limits/compatibility” bullets if mentioned.
- Avoid: deep internal design rationale, pictures, proofs, marketing fluff.

Output structure:
1) `## Practical notes` (bullets)
2) `## Settings & knobs` (bullets, `name = value` when possible)
3) `## Examples` (0–2 fenced SQL blocks + 1–3 bullets)
4) `## Gotchas` (bullets)
5) `## Verification` (0–1 fenced SQL block + 2–6 bullets)
