# Skills

This repository contains skills used for ClickHouse DB performance and schema analysis and helper workflows.

## Core Skills
- `altinity-expert-clickhouse/`: Modular ClickHouse diagnostic skill set. Each module is a standalone skill under `altinity-expert-clickhouse/skills/` (e.g., memory, merges, replication).
- `automations/`: Batch and focus audit scripts that run full ClickHouse analysis and emit a single report.
- `releases/`: Built zip packages for distribution (one per skill).
